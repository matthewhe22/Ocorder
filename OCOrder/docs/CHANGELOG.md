# TOCS OC Portal — Changelog

## 2026-05-13 — Cosmetic / leftover polish round

Cleared the remaining items from the review backlog.

- **TTL mismatch documented** between `writeAuthority` (90 d) and `writeCertificate` (365 d) — by design (KV is a hot cache, SharePoint is canonical for both), but the asymmetry was undocumented and surprising.
- **`URL.createObjectURL` revocation tightened** — the previous `setTimeout(..., 1000)` fired regardless of component lifecycle and held the blob in memory unnecessarily. Now revokes on the next macrotask (after the browser has scheduled the synthetic-click download), inside a `try/finally`.
- **RFC 5987 `filename*=` parser** added to `streamResponseAsDownload` — SharePoint and some Graph endpoints emit this form for non-ASCII filenames; the previous parser fell back to a generic `certificate-<id>.pdf` for those.
- **401 toast pattern propagated** to `updateOrderStatus` (and therefore `markPaid` / `markPending` via the shared handler), the order delete flow, and the amend handler. Pattern now matches `downloadCertificate` / `openAuthorityDoc` / `saveOrderToSharePoint` (added in earlier rounds).
- **SP-disabled log line** in the Stripe webhook so ops can grep Vercel logs for "SP archival skipped for `<orderId>`" without having to cross-reference the order's audit log to see why a folder is missing.
- **Rate-limit keyed on token-hash as well as IP** for `save-to-sharepoint` — defence in depth. A token leaked across many IPs is now bounded (token-hash bucket), and an admin IP behind a NAT shared with another admin is no longer eaten by the other admin (IP buckets are separate). Either limit tripping returns 429 with the longer `Retry-After` of the two.

## 2026-05-13 — Polish tier: tenant lockdown, button accessibility, toast wording, content-type sniffing

Polish-tier follow-ups from the same review pass; no behaviour-breaking changes.

- **`SHAREPOINT_ALLOWED_HOSTS` env var** now narrows the redirect allow-list to the operator's actual tenant (e.g. `tocsau.sharepoint.com,tocsau-my.sharepoint.com`). Falls back to the broad SharePoint Online / Microsoft namespace when unset (current behaviour). Suffix match, so `*.tocsau.sharepoint.com` is covered. (`api/orders/[id]/[action].js`)
- **`X-Doc-Source` header** explicitly tells the client whether `/certificate` and `/authority` responses are a SharePoint redirect (`sharepoint`) or a binary stream (`blob`). Frontend prefers this header over Content-Type sniffing; the legacy Content-Type fallback is kept for graceful upgrade. Fixes the edge case where `text/json` or a missing charset would have routed the response to the wrong handler.
- **`alreadyPresent` toast now lists what's there** — instead of *"All documents are already in SharePoint — nothing to do."* it reads *"SharePoint already has order summary, authority doc, payment receipt for this order — no re-upload needed."* using the URLs the server returns in the idempotent path.
- **All Save-to-SharePoint buttons disable while any save is in flight** — previously only the active row's button disabled; clicking a different row's button during an in-flight save was silently swallowed. Buttons now show as visibly disabled (50% opacity) on other rows with a tooltip explaining why.
- **`aria-label` + `aria-busy`** on all the new admin buttons (Download Certificate, Authority Doc, Invoice link, Save to SharePoint). Screen readers now announce them correctly and the spinner state is exposed via `aria-busy`.
- **Verified audit (no fix needed)**: `OCOrder/server.js:1086` and `api/orders/index.js:395` both construct `lotAuthorityFile` from the server-generated order ID plus a whitelisted/scrubbed extension. No user-controlled string flows into the filename.

## 2026-05-13 — Tier-3 follow-ups: token leak on /authority + /data, XFF spoofing, popup-blocker, bidi sanitisation

Seven issues from the second review pass over PR #37:

### Security
- **`?token=` query fallback removed from `GET /api/orders/:id/authority` and `GET /api/data`** — same Referer/log leak vector that PR #37 closed for `/certificate` was still open on these two endpoints. `/authority` is the worst case because it used to issue a 302 to SharePoint, carrying the admin token to `*.sharepoint.com` via `Referer`. The endpoint now mirrors `/certificate`: returns 200 `{url}` JSON for the SharePoint case (frontend opens it via a synthesised `<a target="_blank">` click) and streams the binary for the Redis KV fallback. Bearer header only.
- **`clientIp()` hardened against `x-forwarded-for` rotation** (`api/_lib/store.js`). The previous implementation returned `xff.split(",")[0]` — the *leftmost* entry, which on Vercel is the client-supplied value. A leaked admin token could rotate the header per request and bypass `save-to-sharepoint`'s 10/60s rate limit (and the `/track` rate limit). New selection order: `x-vercel-forwarded-for` → rightmost entry of `x-forwarded-for` → `req.socket?.remoteAddress`.
- **Unicode bidi / zero-width sanitisation in `sanitiseSegment`** — RTL override (U+202E) and ZW joiners are now stripped; segments are NFKC-normalised first. Not a traversal vector (Graph's path resolver was already safe per the security reviewer's analysis) but a phishing/UI-spoof primitive in admin audit-log surfaces and toasts.

### Correctness
- **Webhook SP IIFE bails when status flipped away from `Paid`** during the upload window — an admin cancelling the order between the lock release and the IIFE running no longer ends up with PDFs uploaded to a cancelled order. `readData` failure (Redis blip) now distinguishes "not found / not Paid" (skip) from "read failed" (fall back to the stale snapshot, better than dropping the upload).
- **`pushAuditOnce` helper** suppresses duplicate "SP upload failed" audit entries on webhook retries — a persistently misconfigured SharePoint deployment that previously produced ~288 duplicate rows per day now produces one rolling failure entry per 24 h. Only failure entries are deduped; successes still always append.

### UX
- **`window.open` replaced with a synthesised `<a target="_blank">.click()`** for the Download Certificate (and now Open Authority Doc) JSON-redirect path. Safari and Firefox routinely block `window.open` when the user-gesture context has been consumed by the preceding `await fetch`; the bytes branch worked because `<a>.click()` is gesture-exempt. Both endpoints now use the same helpers (`openUrlInNewTab`, `streamResponseAsDownload`).
- **`pubConfig` refreshed after SharePoint settings save** — enabling SP in Storage settings no longer requires a full page reload before the "↑ Save to SharePoint" button appears in the Orders tab.

## 2026-05-13 — PR #35/#36 tier-2 follow-ups: token leakage, open redirect, locking, rate limit, polish

Six issues from the same review pass as PR #36, plus three polish items:

### Security
- **`?token=` query-string fallback removed from `GET /api/orders/:id/certificate`** — the long-lived admin token would otherwise leak via Vercel access logs, browser history, and the `Referer` header when the response opens a SharePoint URL. The frontend already supplies the token via the `Authorization` header. Mirrored in `OCOrder/server.js`.
- **Host allow-list on the `/authority` 302 redirect** — `res.redirect(302, order.lotAuthorityUrl)` is now gated by `isAllowedRedirectHost()`, which checks the target is HTTPS and on `*.sharepoint.com`, `*.onmicrosoft.com`, or `*.microsoft.com`. A corrupted or forged `lotAuthorityUrl` value can no longer turn the portal into an open redirector / phishing chain.
- **`save-to-sharepoint` is now rate-limited** — `rateLimit('sp-save:'+ip, 10, 60)` blocks a leaked token from amplifying PDF generation + Graph API uploads into a function-quota / Graph-rate DoS. 429 with `Retry-After` header. Frontend surfaces a distinct "Too many SharePoint saves" toast.

### Correctness
- **`withOrderLock` around the post-upload audit writes** in both the Stripe webhook SP IIFE and `save-to-sharepoint`. A concurrent `amend` / `status` / `check-piq-payment` / `send-cert` no longer clobbers the URLs or audit entries the SP IIFE just produced.
- **Fresh-snapshot read inside the webhook SP IIFE before generating the order summary PDF** — the status-flip lock was released before the IIFE started; if an admin amended the order in between, the generated PDF would have been a stale snapshot. The IIFE now re-reads inside the IIFE so the PDF matches Redis.
- **`save-to-sharepoint` 503 on lock contention** — wraps the read-modify-write in `withOrderLock` and returns 503 ("Order is busy — please try again") on conflict instead of overwriting.

### UX / polish
- **Save-to-SharePoint button gated on `sharepointEnabled`** — exposed via the existing public-config endpoint (`/api/config/public`, boolean only). In local dev / demo / deployments without SP creds the button no longer renders, so clicks don't 400 with "SharePoint is not configured".
- **Download Certificate button hidden for legacy `Issued` orders without a stored copy** — previously the button showed and the click 404'd. Admin now sees no button until the certificate is (re-)sent with the PDF attached.
- **Webhook opportunistic SP upload on retries** — if `checkout.session.completed` arrives for an order that's already Paid but whose SP folder was never populated (an earlier run died mid-flight), the SP block now runs from the retry instead of just acknowledging. The email block is gated on `isFreshPayment` so customers don't receive duplicate confirmation emails.
- **Distinct 401 / 429 toasts in `saveOrderToSharePoint`** — matches the pattern in `downloadCertificate`.
- **Graph error notes truncated to 60 chars** in SP audit-log entries to avoid leaking internal SP folder paths via error response bodies.

## 2026-05-13 — PR #35 follow-ups: webhook lifetime, SP path traversal, download fix, idempotency

Four issues uncovered by a code-review pass over the merged PR #35:

1. **Stripe webhook dropped SP uploads after responding 200** — the previous fix moved SP work into a fire-and-forget IIFE and `await spPromise`'d after `res.status(200).json(...)`. Vercel Node serverless does not extend the function past `res.end()` (no `waitUntil` shim was used), so the SP block could be cancelled mid-flight. Combined with `tryClaimStripeEvent` already burning the Stripe event ID, this re-introduced the exact silent-failure mode PR #35 was meant to fix. `api/stripe-webhook/index.js` now awaits `spPromise` *before* sending the 200.
2. **SharePoint path traversal via user-controlled fields** — `orderSharePointSubFolder` only stripped `[\\/:*?"<>|]`. A customer submitting an order with `items[0].planName = ".."` produced a subfolder like `../OC-Certificates/…`, and `uploadOrderDocs` similarly concatenated the raw client-supplied `authDoc.filename` (e.g. `../../pwned.pdf`) into the upload path. Both paths funnel into Graph's `root:/{path}:/content`, which resolves `..` segments. Added a `sanitiseSegment` helper that strips control chars, leading/trailing dots and whitespace, and rejects dot-only segments to a safe fallback. Applied to `planName`, `order.id`, and authority filename.
3. **`downloadCertificate` silently failed on the common SharePoint-redirect path** — server returned `302 → certificateUrl`, the frontend `fetch(..., { redirect: "follow" })` followed cross-origin without CORS headers, response was opaque, and the admin got a generic "Could not download certificate" toast on the happy path. Server now returns `200 { url }` JSON for the SharePoint case and binary only for the KV/local fallback; frontend opens the URL in a new tab and only streams a blob when the response is binary. Distinct toast for 401/session-expired.
4. **`save-to-sharepoint` was not actually idempotent** — every click appended 1–3 audit-log rows even when URLs were already populated and unconditionally re-uploaded. The handler now gates each doc kind on the current order state (`needSummary = !order.summaryUrl`, etc.) and short-circuits with `{ ok: true, alreadyPresent: true }` when nothing is missing. A new "All documents are already in SharePoint — nothing to do." toast surfaces this in the UI.

## 2026-05-13 — Stripe webhook now uploads to SharePoint; admin Save-to-SharePoint button

### Bug
Several Stripe-paid orders (`TOCS-MOJI6FCL-YLC`, `TOCS-MOI215N8-GR4`, `TOCS-MOC7WG47-2ZZ`, ...) ended up with **no SharePoint folder at all** — not even the `order-summary.pdf` that's supposed to be created when payment is confirmed. Audit logs split into two distinct failure modes:

- **Mode A (`Payment confirmed via Stripe webhook`)** — `api/stripe-webhook/index.js` marked the order Paid and sent emails but never called `uploadToSharePoint`. When Stripe's server-to-server webhook beat the customer's browser to `stripe-confirm`, the SP upload block in `stripe-confirm` short-circuited on `status === "Paid"` and nothing was ever uploaded.
- **Mode B (`Order summary SP upload failed` / `Payment receipt SP upload failed`)** — `stripe-confirm` did run but the Graph API calls failed (timeout / token / network). The order moved on, the failures were audited, but there was no in-portal way to retry.

### Fix
- **`api/_lib/sharepoint.js`** — Added `isSharePointEnabled(spConfig)`, `orderSharePointSubFolder(order)`, and an `uploadOrderDocs(order, spConfig, pdf, opts)` helper that uploads `order-summary.pdf` + (optional) `authority-*` + (optional) `payment-receipt.pdf` to the canonical per-order subfolder and returns `{ authUrl, summaryUrl, receiptUrl, errors }`.
- **`api/stripe-webhook/index.js`** — Now calls `uploadOrderDocs` (with receipt) in parallel with emails; persists the URLs back onto the order; writes the same audit-log entries as `stripe-confirm`. The webhook responds to Stripe immediately, then awaits the SP IIFE in the Vercel post-response window.
- **`api/orders/[id]/[action].js`** — New `POST /api/orders/:id/save-to-sharepoint` admin endpoint regenerates the order summary (and receipt for paid Stripe orders), uploads alongside the authority doc, and writes URLs + audit entries. Idempotent — safe to retry.
- **Frontend (`src/App.jsx`)** — A `↑ Save to SharePoint` button now appears in the Documents section of any Paid/Issued/Processing order missing a `summaryUrl` (or, for Stripe orders, missing `receiptUrl`). One click repairs the SP folder.

### Recovering the affected orders
Open each broken order in Admin → Orders, expand it, and click **↑ Save to SharePoint** in the Documents section. The button creates `<Building>/OC-Certificates/<orderId>/` on SharePoint and uploads `order-summary.pdf`, the authority doc (if stored in Redis KV), and `payment-receipt.pdf` (Stripe orders only). After that, re-send the certificate with the PDF attached to populate the certificate copy too.

---

## 2026-05-13 — Send-Certificate: require attachment, persist a re-downloadable copy

### Bug
Two recent OC certificate orders (`TOCS-MOJI6FCL-YLC` and `TOCS-MOI215N8-GR4`) were marked **Issued** in the portal but the applicants received no attachment, and no SharePoint folder was created under the building. Root cause: `SendCertificateModal` labelled the file picker as **"(optional)"** and neither the frontend nor `send-certificate` rejected an empty submission. With zero attachments:
- the email was delivered with only the cover note (no PDF),
- the SharePoint upload block was gated by `if (attachments.length > 0)` and skipped, so no `…/<Building>/OC-Certificates/<orderId>/` folder was created,
- the order was still moved to **Issued**, masking the failure.

### Fix
- **Frontend (`src/App.jsx`)** — `SendCertificateModal` now requires at least one file before the Send button is enabled; the attachments label is marked required and copy updated from *"optional"* to *"required"*.
- **Vercel handler (`api/orders/[id]/[action].js`)** — `send-certificate` returns 400 when no attachment is supplied. After a successful send, the first attachment is also persisted to Redis KV (`tocs:certificate:<orderId>`, 365 d TTL) and the order is annotated with `certificateFile` + `certificateContentType` so the file can be re-served when the SharePoint link is missing.
- **Local server (`OCOrder/server.js`)** — Same attachment-required guard; sent certificate is copied into `uploads/<orderId>-certificate.<ext>` for re-download in dev.
- **`api/_lib/store.js`** — New `writeCertificate` / `readCertificate` helpers mirror the authority-doc pattern.

### Feature — Admin re-download
- **`GET /api/orders/:id/certificate`** (Vercel + local) — admin-only endpoint that redirects to the SharePoint view URL when present, otherwise streams the stored copy from Redis KV / `uploads/`.
- **Frontend** — every issued OC Certificate order now shows a **Download Certificate** button in the Documents section. Clicking it fetches the bytes (or follows the SP redirect) and triggers a browser download.

### Operational note
The two affected orders pre-date this change and have no stored copy on either store. The fix prevents recurrence and gives admins a one-click re-download for all future issued certificates; for the two existing orders the admin must re-send the certificate (with the PDF attached) to populate the new storage and the SharePoint folder.

## 2026-05-06 — Send-Certificate / Send-Invoice: multipart upload (fix for Vercel 4.5 MB body limit)

### Bug
Sending a ~3.9 MB OC certificate PDF through the admin portal failed with `Network error: Unexpected token 'R', "Request En"... is not valid JSON`. Root cause: the frontend base64-encoded the PDF into a JSON body, inflating it ~33% to ~5.3 MB — exceeding Vercel's 4.5 MB serverless request limit. Vercel returned a plain-text `Request Entity Too Large` page that the client tried to `JSON.parse`.

### Fix
- **Frontend (`src/App.jsx`)** — `SendCertificateModal` and `SendInvoiceModal` now upload the PDF as `multipart/form-data` (raw binary, no base64 inflation). Added `safeReadResponse()` helper that detects non-JSON error bodies (e.g. 413) and surfaces a meaningful error message instead of the JSON parse error.
- **Vercel handler (`api/orders/[id]/[action].js`)** — Added `parseMultipart()` + `readMessageAndAttachment()` helpers. Both routes now accept multipart (preferred) and legacy JSON+base64 (backward-compatible). Attachment is normalised to a Buffer.
- **Local server (`OCOrder/server.js`)** — `send-certificate` / `send-invoice` route now branches on Content-Type: multipart uses the existing `readMultipart()`, JSON uses `readBody()`.
- **`api/_lib/sharepoint.js`** — `uploadToSharePoint()` now accepts a Buffer or a base64 string for the file argument (avoids re-encoding round-trip on the multipart path).

A 3.9 MB PDF is now ~3.95 MB on the wire (multipart overhead is small) — well within the 4.5 MB cap.

## 2026-03-26 — Code Optimisation, Security & Demo/Shadow Environment

### Code Quality & Optimisation
- **`createSmtpTransporter` helper** — Extracted from 5 duplicated `nodemailer.createTransport` call sites into a single shared function.
- **`VALID_STATUSES` module constant** — Moved from local variable inside PUT handler to module level; used consistently across all status references.
- **`send-certificate` + `send-invoice` merged** — Single handler with `isCert` flag replaces two near-identical request handlers.
- **`filteredOrders` via `useMemo`** — Moved from inline recalculation on every render to memoized computation in Admin component.
- **SESSIONS expiry cleanup** — Added 30-min interval purge (with `.unref()`) to evict expired session tokens from memory.
- **TOCTOU fix: authority file deletion** — Replaced `existsSync` guard with `unlinkSync` + `ENOENT` catch.
- **Double `readData()` eliminated** — POST /api/orders now uses a single data read for both price validation and order write.
- **`useMemo` import added** to App.jsx.

### Security Fixes
- **Server-generated order IDs** — Client-supplied `id` field on POST /api/orders is now ignored; server generates `TOCS-{base36}-{hex4}` format.
- **Stripe payment gate** — Orders with `payment: "stripe"` rejected (400) if Stripe is not configured; bank/payid validated against `paymentMethods` flags.
- **Dead status strings removed from frontend** — `Mark Paid` button condition simplified from 4 dead status checks to just `"Pending Payment"`.
- **`orderCategory` dep fix** — Added `orderCategory` to `useEffect` dependency array fixing stale closure bug.

### Demo / Shadow Environment
- **Environment-variable driven multi-instance** — `DATA_FILE`, `CONFIG_FILE`, `UPLOADS_DIR`, `PORT`, `DEMO_MODE` env vars allow running production and demo instances from the same codebase.
- **`DEMO_SEED_DATA`** — 2 strata plans (SP10001 Harbour View, SP10002 Parkside Gardens) with 7 pre-seeded orders covering all order statuses.
- **`DEMO_DEFAULT_CONFIG`** — Demo admin credentials (`demo@tocs.co / Demo@1234`), demo payment details, no SMTP.
- **Auto-seed on first launch** — Demo mode writes seed data and config at startup if the files don't exist.
- **`/api/demo/reset` endpoint** — Resets both data and config to seed state, clears all sessions. Returns 403 in production mode.
- **`demoMode` in `/api/config/public`** — Frontend reads this flag to show/hide the demo banner.
- **Demo banner in App.jsx** — Yellow top bar displayed when `pubConfig.demoMode === true`, showing credentials and a "Reset Demo" button that calls the reset endpoint and reloads the page.
- **Startup banner** — Shows `Mode: DEMO 🔄 / Production`, `Data` file, and `Config` file paths.
- **`npm run demo` script** — `DATA_FILE=demo-data.json CONFIG_FILE=demo-config.json UPLOADS_DIR=uploads-demo PORT=3001 DEMO_MODE=true node server.js`.

## 2026-03-26 — Admin E2E Round 7: Config Parity, Plan Validation & Data Migration

### P2 Security / Crash Fixes

- **BUG-07-01: `paymentMethods` silently ignored on `POST /api/config/settings`** — Added `paymentMethods` handling; `bankEnabled`/`payidEnabled` booleans now persisted. `GET /api/config/settings` now returns `paymentMethods` object.
- **BUG-07-02: String `secondaryPrice` (e.g. `"99"`) stored in catalog → `toFixed()` crash in all email builders** — Plan validation now requires `secondaryPrice` to be a finite non-negative number. Order item price assignment now coerces both `price` and `secondaryPrice` through `Number()`.

### P3 Fixes

- **BUG-07-03: Products without an `id` field accepted silently into plan catalog** — Plan validation now requires every product to have a non-empty string `id`.
- **BUG-07-04: `logo` field returned by `GET /api/config/public` but unsettable** — `POST /api/config/settings` now accepts a `logo` string and persists it; `GET /api/config/settings` returns the current logo value.

### P4 Fixes

- **BUG-07-05: 84 legacy orders missing `status` field** — `readData()` now back-fills missing `status` as `"Pending Payment"` on every read (non-destructive migration).
- **BUG-07-06: `change-credentials` accepted new password identical to current** — Now returns 400 `"New password must differ from the current password."`.

---

## 2026-03-25 — Admin E2E Round 6: Admin Hardening, Shipping Total & Data Leaks

### P2 Security / Data Integrity Fixes

- **BUG-01: CRLF injected into admin `username` via add-admin** — Username now stripped of control chars (`\x00–\x1f`) before storage.
- **BUG-04: String product price (e.g. `"free"`) passed plan validation → NaN → $0 order** — Plan product validation now requires `typeof price === "number"` and `Number.isFinite(price)`.
- **BUG-05: `managerAdminCharge` exposed in unauthenticated `GET /api/data`** — Public response now strips `managerAdminCharge` from all plan products.
- **BUG-06: `selectedShipping.price` not included in `order.total`** — Total now sums item prices plus `selectedShipping.price`; shipping cost also re-validated server-side as non-negative.
- **BUG-07: `managerAdminCharge` returned to customer in order placement response** — `POST /api/orders` response now strips `managerAdminCharge` from item objects before returning to caller.
- **BUG-08: CRLF accepted in `paymentDetails` fields on config save** — `stripCRLF()` now applied to all `paymentDetails` string values.

### P3 Fixes

- **BUG-02: No max length on admin username** — `add-admin` now rejects usernames longer than 200 characters.
- **BUG-03: Negative `managerAdminCharge` accepted in plan products** — Plan product validation now rejects non-numeric or negative `managerAdminCharge`.
- **BUG-09: No upper cap on `item.qty`** — `qty` now capped at 100 per item.

---

## 2026-03-25 — Admin E2E Round 5: Field Whitelisting, Config Hardening & Parity

### P2 Security Fixes

- **BUG-01: `selectedShipping` stored verbatim including `__proto__` injection** — Now whitelisted to `{type, price}` only; `price` cast to non-negative number.
- **BUG-02: `items[]` used `...item` spread, persisting arbitrary client fields** — Replaced with explicit whitelist: `productId`, `lotId`, `lotNumber`, `planName`, `ocName`, `productName`, `ocId`, `qty` only; `price` and `managerAdminCharge` overridden from server catalog.
- **BUG-04: CRLF accepted in `emailTemplate` fields (header injection risk)** — `POST /api/config/settings` now strips `\r\n` from all email template string values via `stripCRLF()`.
- **BUG-05: CRLF accepted in `smtp.host` / `smtp.user`** — Both fields stripped of CRLF on save.
- **BUG-06: `adminNotificationIntro` rendered as raw HTML in admin notification email** — Now wrapped with `esc()` in `buildOrderEmailHtml`.

### P3 Fixes

- **BUG-03: New orders stored without `status` field** — Orders now created with `"Pending Payment"` (bank/payid/invoice) or `"Processing"` (stripe/card).
- **BUG-07: `smtp.pass` returned in plaintext in GET `/api/config/settings`** — Now masked as `"••••••••"` when set; POST handler ignores the placeholder on save.
- **BUG-08: Hardcoded default `adminNotificationSubject` still contained `{total}`** — Both occurrences updated to `"New Order — {orderType} #{orderId}"`.
- **BUG-09: Local server `/api/config/public` missing `bankEnabled`, `payidEnabled`, `stripeEnabled`, `logo`** — Local server now returns identical shape to Vercel `api/config/public.js`; `Cache-Control: no-store` header added.

### P4 Fixes

- **BUG-10: No length cap on `contactInfo.name` / `companyName`** — Now enforced at 200 chars each.
- **BUG-11: `qty` stored on items but not used in total (keys/fob orders)** — Non-perOC items now priced as `product.price × qty`; `qty` normalised to a positive integer in the item whitelist.
- **BUG-12: `smtp.host` accepted internal IPs / CRLF (SSRF vector)** — CRLF stripped from `smtp.host` on save (full hostname validation deferred).

---

## 2026-03-25 — Admin E2E Round 4: Order Integrity, Input Validation & XSS

### P2 Security Fixes

- **BUG-01: Order with missing/invalid `planId` bypassed all price enforcement** — `POST /api/orders` now requires `planId` to match a known plan; returns 400 `"A valid planId is required."` if absent or unrecognised.
- **BUG-02: Unknown `productId` bypassed item price enforcement** — Each item's `productId` is now validated against the plan catalog; returns 400 `"Unknown productId: ..."` rather than silently accepting the client-supplied price.

### P3 Functional / Security Fixes

- **BUG-03: Dead `/api/admin` route returned 405 for all requests** — Removed the stale entry from `knownRoutes`; the endpoint has no handler and all credential/admin actions are correctly at `POST /api/auth`.
- **BUG-04: `contactInfo.email` accepted malformed values including CRLF** — Same regex used for `cfg.orderEmail` (`/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`) now applied to the customer email at order placement.
- **BUG-05: CRLF and control characters accepted in `lotNumber`, `planName`, `ocName`, `productName`, `contactInfo` fields** — A `stripCtrl()` helper strips `\x00–\x1f` and `\x7f` from all string fields before they are stored or substituted into email subjects.
- **BUG-06: Lots without an `id` field silently dropped; import returned `{"ok":true,"count":0}`** — `POST /api/lots/import` now validates every lot object has a non-empty `id`; returns 400 `"Each lot must have a non-empty id field."`.
- **BUG-08: Admin `message` in certificate email rendered as raw HTML (XSS)** — `buildCertEmailHtml` now wraps `message` with `esc()` before inserting into the HTML body.

### P3 UX Fix

- **BUG-07: `POST /api/plans` with a flat array returned misleading `"Invalid plans."` error** — Error message updated to `'Body must be {"plans": [...]}'`.

---

## 2026-03-25 — Manager Admin Charge for Keys/Fob Products

### New Feature

- **Manager Admin Charge field on Keys/Fob products** — When setting up a Keys/Fobs/Remotes product for a building, admins can now enter a "Manager Admin Charge (AUD)" amount. This field is:
  - Only visible in the product add/edit modal when the category is "Keys / Fobs / Remotes"
  - Not shown to applicants at any point in the order flow
  - Stored in the strata plan's product record in `data.json`
  - Snapshotted onto each order item (`item.managerAdminCharge`) at order creation time, taken from the plan catalog server-side (tamper-proof)
  - Exported as a "Manager Admin Charge (AUD)" column in the admin CSV export — calculated as the sum of each item's charge multiplied by quantity; blank if zero

---

## 2026-03-25 — Admin E2E Round 3: Docs, Email & Payment Hardening (server.js)

### Medium Severity Bug Fixes

- **CRLF in `lotAuthorityFile` crashed the server (DoS)** — `lotAuthorityFile` is now sanitised with `replace(/[^\w.\-]/g, "_")` before use in the `Content-Disposition` header. The `fs.readFile` callback is wrapped in try/catch so header errors cannot escape to an uncaught handler and crash the process.
- **Authority file overwritten before duplicate order check** — The duplicate ID check is now performed before `fs.writeFileSync`, so a repeated submission with the same order ID can no longer overwrite the original authority document on disk.
- **`paymentDetails` fields unescaped in customer confirmation email (XSS)** — `pd.accountName`, `pd.bsb`, `pd.accountNumber`, and `pd.payid` are now all wrapped in `esc()` in `buildCustomerEmailHtml`. A malicious admin storing XSS payloads in payment config can no longer inject HTML into customer bank-transfer/PayID emails.

### Low Severity Bug Fixes

- **`order.lotAuthorityFile` unescaped in admin notification email** — Wrapped in `esc()` in `buildOrderEmailHtml`.
- **`order.id` unescaped in all three email templates** — Wrapped in `esc()` in every HTML context across all three email builders.
- **`orderEmail` display text unescaped in customer email footer** — Both the `href` and display text of the contact link now use `esc()`.

### Input Validation

- **`orderEmail` not validated as a proper email address** — `POST /api/config/settings` now checks `orderEmail` against a basic email pattern before saving; returns 400 if it fails.

### Reliability

- **Email failures not recorded in auditLog** — `sendOrderEmail` and `sendCustomerEmail` are now awaited via `Promise.allSettled()`. If either send fails, a `"Email send failed"` entry with the error message is appended to the order's `auditLog`, giving admins an in-app record of delivery failures.

## 2026-03-25 — Admin E2E Round 2: Security & Integrity Hardening (server.js)

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Path traversal via `lotAuthorityFile`** — `POST /api/orders` now uses a field whitelist; `lotAuthorityFile` and all other admin-only fields are stripped before persistence. `GET /api/orders/:id/authority` now resolves the path with `path.basename()` and asserts the result is inside `UPLOADS_DIR`, preventing arbitrary file reads (including `config.json` and `/etc/passwd`).

### High Severity Bug Fixes

- **Per-item prices not validated against catalog (fraud vector)** — `POST /api/orders` now looks up each `item.productId` in the plan's products list and overwrites `item.price` with the server-authoritative price (applying `secondaryPrice` for additional OC items on `perOC` products). Clients can no longer set item prices to 1 cent.
- **Arbitrary order fields persisted from client** — Field whitelist on order creation: only `id`, `planId`, `lotId`, `orderCategory`, `contactInfo`, `payment`, `items`, `selectedShipping` are stored. Client-supplied `status`, `cancelReason`, `adminNotes`, `lotAuthorityFile` and any other field are stripped before persistence.

### Medium Severity Bug Fixes

- **Order IDs with slashes/spaces permanently unreachable** — `POST /api/orders` rejects IDs containing `/`, `\`, `?`, whitespace, `#`, or control characters. Max length 100 characters.
- **Executable file extensions accepted for authority upload** — Extension now validated against `[.pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, .png]`; anything else stored as `.bin`.
- **Duplicate lot IDs accepted in lots import** — `POST /api/lots/import` deduplicates by `id` (last occurrence wins) before writing.
- **Empty lots array silently wiped all lots** — `POST /api/lots/import` now returns 400 if `lots` array is empty.

### Low Severity Bug Fixes

- **Embedded newlines in CSV fields broke row structure** — CSV export now strips `\r`, `\n`, `\t` from all field values before quoting.

### Input Validation & Error Improvements

- **Oversized body returned connection-reset with no HTTP status** — `readBody()` now sends HTTP 413 with a JSON error body before `req.destroy()`.
- **Wrong HTTP methods returned 404** — Known API routes now return 405 Method Not Allowed with an `Allow:` header.
- **Empty `orderEmail` accepted** — `POST /api/config/settings` rejects empty/non-string `orderEmail` with 400.
- **Non-numeric SMTP port silently fell back to 587** — `smtp.port` now validated as a finite positive number; invalid values return 400.

---

## 2026-03-25 — Admin E2E Security & Validation Hardening (server.js)

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Fraud-proof order total** — `POST /api/orders` now recalculates `total = Σ(item.price)` server-side; any client-supplied `total` is overridden. Prevents a $1 submission for $220 items.
- **Plan data corruption** — `POST /api/plans` now validates each plan is an object with a non-empty `id` (string) and `name` (string). Sending garbage like `[42, null, "string"]` now returns 400 instead of overwriting the entire plans database.

### High Severity Bug Fixes

- **send-certificate crash on null contactInfo** — Extracted `recipientEmail = order.contactInfo?.email` before SMTP setup; returns `400 "Order has no customer email address."` instead of throwing `TypeError` when an order has no contactInfo.
- **Status enum validation** — `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` now requires status to be one of `["Pending Payment","Processing","Issued","Cancelled","On Hold","Awaiting Documents","Invoice to be issued"]`; null, empty string, and arbitrary values all return 400.
- **XSS in HTML emails** — Added `esc()` HTML-escape helper (encodes `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`); applied to all user-supplied fields (`name`, `email`, `phone`, `companyName`, `productName`, `ocName`, `lotNumber`, `address`) in all three email builders.
- **Empty plans wipe** — `POST /api/plans` with `plans: []` now returns `400 "Plans array cannot be empty."` instead of silently deleting all strata plan data.
- **Duplicate plan IDs** — Plans submitted with duplicate `id` values are deduplicated (last occurrence wins) before writing.

### Medium Severity Bug Fixes

- **Authority doc 404 ambiguity** — `GET /api/orders/:id/authority` now returns `"Order not found."` when the order ID doesn't exist, distinct from `"No authority document for this order."` when the order exists but has no file attached.
- **Negative product prices** — `POST /api/plans` validates each product's `price >= 0`; returns 400 with the offending product name.

### Input Validation Improvements (Gaps)

- **Empty items array** — `POST /api/orders` with `items: []` now returns `400 "Order must contain at least one item."`.
- **Required contact info** — `POST /api/orders` requires `contactInfo.name` and `contactInfo.email` as non-empty strings; returns 400 if missing.
- **Order date normalisation** — `date` field is parsed and normalised to ISO 8601 on arrival; defaults to server time if missing or unparseable (previously stored invalid strings like `"not-a-date"`).

### Minor Fixes

- **CSV export auth header** — `GET /api/orders/export` now accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in addition to `?token=` query param, avoiding session token exposure in server logs.

## 2026-03-21 — Bug Fixes, Keys Shipping, SP Uploads for Stripe

### Bug Fixes
- **Admin Orders blank page (crash)** — Two root causes fixed:
  1. `<>` shorthand fragment inside `.map()` had no `key` prop → changed to `<React.Fragment key={o.id}>`
  2. `o.items.length` and `o.items.map()` crashed for orders with missing `items` array → guarded with `(o.items || [])`

- **SMTP Test Email always fails after page reload** — `test-email.js` was forwarding the masked `••••••••` placeholder as the actual SMTP password. Fixed: if body sends masked value, API falls back to the real stored password from Redis config.

- **Keys/Fobs "Added" visual feedback broken** — Product cards never showed quantity controls (−/qty/+) after adding a Keys product. Root cause: `allAdded` used `inCart()` which checks key format `pid-null-lotId`, but keys products were stored with key `pid-null-lotId-keys`. Fixed: compute `cartItem` first, then use `!!cartItem` for `allAdded` on keys orders.

- **Contact step subtitle incorrect for Keys orders** — Step 4 always said "We'll send your order confirmation and certificate to these details." Fixed to dynamically show "invoice" for keys orders and "certificate" for OC orders.

### New Features

#### Keys/Fob Shipping Options (Step 4)
Four fixed shipping options now shown on Step 4 for keys/fob orders:
| Option | Cost | Address Required |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Pick up from BM | $0 (fixed) | No |
| Standard Delivery | Configurable per plan | Yes |
| Express Delivery | Configurable per plan | No |
| No Shipment Required | $0 (fixed) | No |

- Address fields show/hide dynamically based on selection
- "Pick up from BM" auto-selected on entry to Step 4
- Admin configures Standard/Express costs via **Plans → Keys Shipping** modal
- Data stored as `plan.keysShipping: { deliveryCost, expressCost }` in Redis
- `selectedShipping` stored on order object as `{ id, name, cost, requiresAddress }`

#### Test SharePoint Button (Admin → Storage)
The existing 4-step SharePoint diagnostic API (`POST /api/config/test-sharepoint`) now has a UI button in the Storage admin tab. Results show step-by-step: `config → auth → site_read → drive_read` with ✅/❌ per step.

#### Email Failure Audit Logging
When admin/customer emails fail to send (SMTP error), the failure message is now written to `order.auditLog` with action `"Email notification failed"`. Previously failures were only logged to Vercel console logs — now visible directly in the Orders admin view.

#### SharePoint Uploads for Stripe Orders
After Stripe payment is confirmed via `stripe-confirm`, three files are now uploaded to SharePoint:
1. `authority-{filename}` — the authority document submitted with the order
2. `order-summary.pdf` — generated order summary
3. `payment-receipt.pdf` — new Stripe payment receipt PDF showing ref, date paid, amount, Stripe session ID

New PDF generator: `generateReceiptPdf(order, sessionId)` added to `api/_lib/pdf.js`.

### SMTP Credentials Updated
- SMTP username changed from `OCCAPP` → `ocorder`
- Password updated in Admin → Settings → SMTP

## 2026-03-20 — Stripe, Privacy Policy, Security & Bug Fixes

### New Features
- **Stripe Checkout** — Card payment via Stripe redirect flow; `stripeEnabled` flag hides option if key not set
- **Privacy Policy** — SPA route `/privacy-policy` with 10 TOCS-branded sections
- **Payment cancelled banner** — Dismissible yellow banner when Stripe redirects back with `?cancelled=1`
- **Order deletion** — Admin can permanently delete Cancelled orders

### Bug Fixes
- **PII protection** — `GET /api/data` returns `orders: []` without valid Bearer token
- **CSV Export** — Now accepts `Authorization: Bearer` header in addition to `?token=`
- **SMTP password** — Masked as `"••••••••"` in settings GET; POST ignores the mask
- **Ghost Stripe orders** — Key + zero-total validation fires BEFORE Redis write
- **CORS** — `DELETE` added to `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- **Status whitelist** — `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` rejects invalid statuses
